## Sprint 1 Review/Retrospective and Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

### Sprint 1 Review/Retrospective

-   What did we accomplish?
    -   Overview of the Voting System and get familiar with the project.
    -   Finishing Design of Class Diagram of Voting system.**(UML Class diagram)**
    -   Building a briefly clear Code Structure based on design consistent of UML Class diagram
    -   Finishing Objective and Design patterns design, such as: Facade patterns, Templete patterns, etc..
    -   The way of storing Persistent data of store, such as using **hibernate** connection of database or **.json** or **.csv** for locally exchanging data
    -   Adding issues on Sprint_1, Burndown charts's populate
    -   Agenda of Spring_1 officially meeting complete
    -   Adding more possible issues on Sprint_2, Burndown charts's populate

-   What didn't we accomplish?
    -   Not so far, since we are trying to intergrate the logic-layer and frontend for the next sprint: Sprint_2, we have made a good progress for sprint_1

-   What were the unexpected obstacles and opportunities?
    -   Merge conflicts
    -   Unexcpeted absent of single teammember could not attend with scrum meetings
    -   Issues too heavy or hard to being solved by a short of time

-   What should we keep doing?
    -   Complete front end functionality
        -   So far we have already finished a nice prototype of the architecture of voting system, the next step we are going to implement is frontend GUI design. Such as Creat Account page, create a new ballot page and voter could view their recorded vote page.

-   What should we stop doing?
    -   Stop with making far away progress of the stating branch without updating, since we met a lot of merge conflicts at the end of intergrate all works together. We will trying to split the works into small pieces and push them every time once we finishing.

-   What should we start doing or do differently?
    -   Make works and issues pieces and implement each part separately for easially finish up
    -   Merge and renew the updating more diligent, avoid huge conflicts of intergating works branch
    -   Highly efficiency division of works


### Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

-   Identify sprint goal
    -   Complete front end functionality
    -   Add create account functionality
    -   Backend Function of implementing the data extraction from database
    -   Requirement issues: A non-technical person must be able to create the ballot for a new election
    -   Front-end: a voter to later view their recorded vote to confirm that it was recorded correctly
    -   Create a logic-layer for the project
-   What backlog items are in this sprint?
-   Prepare sprint backlog
    -   Assign Sprint 2 Issues to `sprint 2` milestone
