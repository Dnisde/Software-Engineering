##  Issues

-   Started since last scrum:
    -   Make the front-end prototype

-   Completed since last scrum:
    -   Make the front-end prototype
        -   Close? Y

-   Any removed from backlog?
    -   Make the front-end prototype

-   Any added to backlog? Why?
    -   Complete front end functionality
        -   So far we have already finished a nice prototype of the architecture of voting system, the next step we are going to implement is frontend GUI design. Such as Creat Account page, create a new ballot page and voter could view their recorded vote page.

    -   Logic Layer start
        -   We have also trying to build a maturing three tier architecture, so we probably need a logic layer building up as soon as possible
